ðŸ‘‹ **Hello! I'm Virti Jain**

I am a graduate student in Data Science at Stony Brook University with a solid foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and data analytics. My experience spans various domains, including energy forecasting, smart grids, and NLP-driven mental health diagnostics. Iâ€™m skilled in Python, SQL, TensorFlow, and data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau, which I use to derive meaningful insights from complex data sets. 

Core Competencies:

Programming & Tools: Python, Java, SQL, TensorFlow, PyTorch, MySQL, Hadoop, MATLAB
Machine Learning & Analytics: Deep Learning (CNN, RNN), NLP, Data Mining, Data Visualization (Power BI, MS Excel)
Development & Collaboration: Full Stack Development, Agile Methodologies, Project Delivery, ETL Processes

**Notable Projects:**
- **Depression Detection Model**: Led a team to enhance a multimodal deep learning model using LSTM networks, increasing accuracy by 15%.
- **Forensic Face Recognition**: Developed a CNN-based criminal identification tool, achieving high accuracy on real-world datasets.

I'm passionate about using data science to solve impactful problems and always open to collaborating on innovative projects. Letâ€™s connect and build something transformative!
